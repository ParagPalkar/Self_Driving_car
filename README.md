JavaScript - Self Driving Car demonstrates the application of Neural Network, 500 cars were generated and the best car which performed no collision is set as best car and the sensors (rays) are set on the best car, the screenshots are present in Source Code. Basic physics are applied on the car like max speed, backward speed, left and right rotation angle, getting disabled on collision and so on. More traffic and features to be added, click on restart the car at starting position.

On the right hand side the visualizer is built based on math to demonstrate the Neural network and to demonstrate the move decision of the car. The bottom layer is the first input layer, whereas the topmost layer is the output layer; the forward, backward (or break), left and right arrows are animated when the car decides to move in that particular direction.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
